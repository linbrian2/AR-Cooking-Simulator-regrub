# AR-Cooking-Simulator-regrub

## Summary
The user will seat himself in front of a table, or an object that serves essentially the same purpose. When the user starts the simulation, he will be tasked to cook certain foods. The goal is to teach them how to cook real life food items, through putting in the correct ingredients, performing tasks in the correct order, and getting the right quantities.
